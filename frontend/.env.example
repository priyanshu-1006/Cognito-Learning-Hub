# Vite Environment Variables for Cognito Learning Hub Frontend

# Backend API URL (IMPORTANT: This should point to API Gateway, not individual services!)
# For local development (API Gateway runs on port 3000):
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
# For production (example - replace with your Render API Gateway URL):
# VITE_API_URL=https://your-api-gateway.onrender.com

# Socket.IO Server URL (same as API Gateway - proxies to Live Service)
# For local development:
VITE_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:3000
# For production (example - replace with your Render API Gateway URL):
# VITE_SOCKET_URL=https://your-api-gateway.onrender.com

# Meeting Service WebSocket URL (for WebRTC signaling - needs direct connection)
# For local development:
VITE_MEETING_WS_URL=ws://localhost:3009
# For production (example - replace with your Render Meeting Service URL):
# VITE_MEETING_WS_URL=wss://meeting-service-xxx.onrender.com

# Google Client ID (for OAuth)
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=499091061377-4k0m8gnios927sua2a9d64nvlh8aorru.apps.googleusercontent.com

# ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES:
# 1. All environment variables for Vite must start with VITE_
# 2. These are exposed to client-side code - don't put sensitive secrets here
# 3. VITE_API_URL should point to BACKEND server URL (where your API is hosted)
# 4. Do NOT include trailing slashes in URLs (they will be handled automatically)
# 5. In production, set these in Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
